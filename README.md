I am specilaized in frontend development (JS, TS, React and CSS) and have experience with web design. I focus on clean code, performance, UX, and improving myself with every project I undertake. 

My professional background is dynamic... 

After graduating with Masters Degree in Law, I specialized in Data Protection and Cyber-Security. My career advanced exceptionally well, including being appointed as the Data Protection Officer, and working in the European Commission (Brussels). 

However, here was a problem. I was never interested in law. Not wanting to spend 40 years, 8 h/day, working in an area I'm not passionate about, I decided to change. 

IT was always close to my heart. That was the reason I specialized in the legal areas mentioned above. I made a few websites in WP during Uni, and played with HTML, CSS and JS since 2015. It was a hobby I dedicated increasing amounts of time to. I remember learning about prototypal inheritance in JS, coding until 4AM, dreaming about optimizations, and waking up at 7 to continue refactoring my code. Then it dawned on me, "This doesn't make sense. This isn't a hoby, I should make this my career."

In 2020 I made the big change. My parents wanted to kill me! However, it is one of the best decisions in my life, and I never looked back. I started working as a web developer / designer, and decided to specialize in frontend development.

I am extremelly happy to be working in an area I actually love and where I trully enjoy what I'm doing!
