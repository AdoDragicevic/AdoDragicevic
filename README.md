I am specilaized in Frontend Development (JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js and CSS), experienced in Web Design, and have basic experience in Backend Development. I focus on Clean Code, Performance, UX, and continual Improvement. 

My professional background is dynamic... 

After graduating with Masters Degree in Law, I specialized in Data Protection and Cyber-Security. My career advanced exceptionally well. However, there was a problem. I was never trully interested in law. Not wanting to spend 40 years, 8 h/day, in an area I was not passionate about, I decided to change. My parents wanted to kill me!
 
In 2020 I started working as a Web Developer / Designer. One of the best decisions in my life, and I never looked back.

I am extremelly happy to work in an area I trully love, and I am continually focused on improving myself.
