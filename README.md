I am specilaized in Frontend Development (JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js and CSS), experienced in Web Design, and have basic experience in Backend Development. I focus on Clean Code, Performance, UX, and continual Improvement. 

My professional background is dynamic... 

After graduating with Masters Degree in Law, I specialized in Data Protection and Cyber-Security. My career advanced exceptionally well, including working as the Data Protection Officer, and working in the European Comission in Brussels.

However, there was a problem. I was never trully interested in law. Not wanting to spend 40 years, 8 h/day, working in an area I am not passionate about, I decided to change. 

IT was always close to my heart. I made a few websites in Uni, and played with WordPress, HTML, CSS and JavaScript since 2015. It was a hobby I dedicated increasing amounts of time to. I remember learning about prototypal inheritance in JS, coding until 4AM, dreaming about classes, and waking up at 7 to continue refactoring my code. 

In 2020 I made the big change. My parents wanted to kill me! It was one of the best decisions in my life, and I never looked back. I started working as a Web Developer / Designer, and decided to specialize in Frontend.

I am extremelly happy to be working in an area I am passinate about, and I am continually focused on improving myself.
