I am specilaized JS, TS, React and CSS. I emphasize writing clean code and becoming a better developer with every project I work on. Besides trying to write code that can be easily understood and scaled, I focus on performance improvements, Big O notation and UX. 

My professional background is dynamic. 

After graduating with Masters Degree in Law, I specialized in Data Protection and Cyber-Security. My career was advancing exceptionally well, including working as the Data Protection Officer, and being part of the legal team in charge of negotiations between the EU and Microsoft in the European Commission, Directorate General for Informatics. 

However, there was a problem. I was never interested in law. Not wanting to spend 40 years, 8 h/day, working in an area I am not passionate about. So I decided to change. 

IT has always been close to my heart, that is part of the reason I specialized in the areas of law mentioned above. I made a few websites in Wordpress during Uni, and played with HTML, CSS and JS since 2015. It was a hobby I never left, and that I dedicated increasing amounts of time on as years passed. I remember learning about prototypal inheritance in JS, I would code until 4AM, dream about classes and optimizations, and wake up at 7 to continue working on personal projects. 

In 2020 I made the big change. My parents wanted to kill me! However, it was one of the best decisions in my life and I never looked back. In 2020 I started working as a web developer / designer. After spending years before with vanilla JS, learning a library like React.js came very easy to me. After workig with hooks I fell in love with the approach react chose, and decided to specialize in frontend.  

I am extremelly happy to be working in an area I love and feel passionate about.
